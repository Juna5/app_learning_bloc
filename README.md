# app_learning_bloc

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Note

This code is based on Flutter learning that you can find on the YouTube channel [dbestech](https://www.youtube.com/@dbestech). I have re-coded this project as part of my learning process. You can watch the original video here:
